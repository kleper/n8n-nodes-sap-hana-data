# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure

- `nodes/`: n8n node implementations (TypeScript). Example: `nodes/SapHanaData/SapHanaData.node.ts` plus shared helpers in `nodes/SapHanaData/utils/`.
- `credentials/`: n8n credential types. Example: `credentials/SapHanaDataApi.credentials.ts`.
- `workflows/`: sample workflow JSON files for manual testing and documentation.
- `dist/`: build output (generated by `tsc` + `gulp`, not committed). The published package exposes compiled files from `dist/**`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install`: install dependencies (Node.js `>=18`).
- `npm run dev`: TypeScript watch build to `dist/` for local iteration.
- `npm run build`: production build (`tsc`) and copy node/credential icons + assets to `dist/` (`gulp build:icons`).
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lintfix`: run ESLint (includes `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` rules for n8n packages).
- `npm run format`: format `nodes/` and `credentials/` with Prettier.
- `npm run clean`: remove `dist/` and local package artifacts (`*.tgz`).
- Local n8n smoke test: `npm pack` then install the generated `.tgz` into your self-hosted n8n user directory (see `README.md`), restart n8n, and run a sample workflow from `workflows/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript is compiled with strict settings (`tsconfig.json`); prefer explicit types and avoid `any` unless required by upstream libraries.
- Keep n8n conventions: node folder name in PascalCase, node file named `*.node.ts`, credential file named `*.credentials.ts`.
- Node metadata (name, icon, parameter labels/descriptions) must follow `n8n-nodes-base` lint rules (e.g., consistent casing, descriptions ending with a period).

## Testing Guidelines

- No automated unit/integration tests are currently configured; treat `npm run lint` as the primary quality gate.
- Validate changes by executing the node in a local self-hosted n8n instance and importing a workflow from `workflows/`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Prefer Conventional Commits (examples in `git log`): `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`.
- PRs should include: summary, rationale, test steps (what you ran in n8n), and any README/workflow updates if the node UI or behavior changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Do not commit SAP HANA service keys, passwords, or workflow exports containing secrets.
- Keep sample workflows generic and scrub identifiers (hosts, schemas, table names) before sharing.
